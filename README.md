Welcome to my **Competitive Programming (CP) Repository**!
C++ algorithm contest library
This library is intented to be used in online contests, or on ACM-style competitions. The target is to make it portable, reusable and extremely easy to modify during the contest. The algorihtms are wrapped into classes/structs so they won't interfere with your functions and variables.
